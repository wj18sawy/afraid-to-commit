# Manifesto for Agile Software Development

We are uncovering better ways of developing <br>
software by doing it and helping others do it.<br>
Through this work we have come to value:<br><br>

Individuals and interactions over processes and tools<br>
Working software over comprehensive documentation<br>
Customer collaboration over contract negotiation<br>
Responding to change over following a plan<br><br>

That is, while there is value in the items on<br>
the right, we value the items on the left more.<br>
